                    I have been interested in web development for about two years. It's not just a job for me, but
                    rather
                    fun. The feeling that I have created something from scratch, something that people will not just
                    use,
                    but enjoy using it fills me with pride and determination. In design, I strive not only for
                    appearance,
                    but also functionality and connectivity with your customers.

                    I am a seventeen-year-old student at a grammar school in České Budějovice. I am a member of the
                    Czech
                    national karate team, which I am very proud of. In addition to karate and website development, I
                    spend
                    my free time watching Netflix, playing PC games with my friends, and occasionally partying or going
                    on
                    adventures.
